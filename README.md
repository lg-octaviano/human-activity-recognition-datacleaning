## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This project's objective is to take a raw data set and produce two tidy data sets.
The raw data set is already pre-processed data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone while someone did a certain activity. 
The full description of the data collection is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
The raw data is available https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

# Files in this project
	- run_analysis.R: a script to take the raw data set and turn it into two tidy data sets. This script assumes that the raw data is already downloaded and unzipped in R's working directory.
	- CodeBook.md: the Code Book for the tidy data sets containing explanations about the variables in each data set, and the transformations performed to generate that data set.
